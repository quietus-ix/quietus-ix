Salve

I'm an average individual aspiring to be a software developer/engineer/architect/dancer.
Currently learning different technologies. Can adapt (probably).
I'm the type of person that installs 456 packages to make a hello world app
Likes coffee. Soon I'll make a digital coffee that people can smell, taste and hear(?).

Have questions? Please hesitate to ask.
