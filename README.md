Salve

I'm an average individual aspiring to be a software developer/engineer/architect/dancer.
Currently learning different technologies. Can adapt (probably).
I also don't like following to the trend that much like using the latest and trendy languages or frameworks. If I need something done, whatever I use will be used.
Likes coffee. Soon I'll make a digital coffee that people can smell, taste and hear(?).

Have questions? Please hesitate to ask.
